Sysl (pronounced "sizzle") is a system specification language. Using Sysl, you
can specify systems, endpoints, endpoint behaviour, data models and data
transformations. The Sysl compiler automatically generates sequence diagrams,
integrations, and other views. It also offers a range of code generation
options, all from one common Sysl specification.

The set of outputs is open-ended and allows for your own extensions. Sysl has been created with extensibility in mind and it will grow to support other representations over time.

Installation
------------

Windows users can download the ``sysl-bundle-windows.zip``, containing ``sysl.exe`` and ``reljam.exe``, from our `release page <https://github.com/anz-bank/sysl/releases>`_.

Users on other operating systems need to work with Python or Docker.

Python
~~~~~~
Install `Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_.
If your specific environment causes problems you might find our `guide <docs/environment_guide.md>`_ helpful.

Install Sysl with ::

  > pip install sysl

Now you can execute Sysl on the command line with ::

  > sysl   textpb -o out/petshop.txt /demo/petshop/petshop
  > reljam model /demo/petshop/petshop PetShopModel

See ``sysl --help`` and ``reljam --help`` for more options.

Docker
~~~~~
Install `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`_ and pull the Docker Image with ::

  > docker pull anzbank/sysl

Consider tagging the docker image to make commands shorter ::

  > docker tag anzbank/sysl sysl

Try the following commands ::

  > docker run sysl
  > docker run sysl sysl -h
  > docker run sysl reljam -h

See `https://hub.docker.com/r/anzbank/sysl/` for more details.

Development
-----------
Install dependencies and the ``sysl`` package with symlinks ::

  > pip install pytest flake8 -e .

Sysl depends upon `PlantUML <http://plantuml.com/>`_ for diagram generation. 
Some of the automated tests require a PlantUML dependency.
Provide PlantUML access either via local installation or URL to remote service. 
Warning, for sensitive data the public service at www.plantuml.com is not suitable. 
You can use one of the following options to set up your environment:

- execute ``SYSL_PLANTUML=http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml``
- add ``export SYSL_PLANTUML=http://www.plantuml.com/plantuml`` to you ``.bashrc`` or similar
- `install PlantUML <http://plantuml.com/starting>`_ locally and run on port 8080


Test and lint the source code and your changes with ::

  > pytest
  > flake8

Consider using `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ and `virtualenvwrapper <https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ to isolate your development environment.

For Java tests install `Java 8 <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/install_overview.html>`_ and `gradle <https://gradle.org/install/>`_ and run ::

 > gradle test -b test/java/build.gradle

If your corporate environment restricts access to ``jcenter`` our `environment guide <docs/environment_guide.md>`_ might hold the answer for you. It also includes tips on using ``virtualenv`` with ``gradle test``.

We encourage contributions to this project! Please have a look at the `contributing guide <CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ for more information.

If you need to create a release follow the `release documentation <docs/releasing.md>`_.


Extending Sysl
--------------
In order to easily reuse and extend Sysl across systems, the Sysl compiler translates Sysl files
into an intermediate representation expressed as protocol buffer messages. These protobuf messages can be consumed in your favorite programming language and transformed to your desired output. In this way you are creating your own Sysl exporter.

Using the `protoc compiler <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/>`_ you can translate the definition file of the intermediate representation ``src/proto/sysl.proto`` into your preferred programming language in a one-off step or on every build. You can then easily consume Sysl models in your programming language of choice in a typesafe way without having to write a ton of mapping
boilerplate. With that you can create your own tailored output diagrams, source code, views, integrations or other desired outputs.

In this project, several Python based exporters exist under ``src/sysl/exporters`` and the relevant Python protobuf definitions ``sysl_pb2.py`` have been created from ``sysl.proto`` with ::

  > protoc --python_out=src/sysl/proto  --proto_path=src/proto sysl.proto

If ``sysl.proto`` is updated, the above command needs to be re-run to update the corresponding Python definitions in ``sysl_pb2.py``.

Status
------
Sysl is currently targeted at early adopters. The current focus is to improve documentation and usability, especially error messages and warnings.
